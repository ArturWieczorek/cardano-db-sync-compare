# cardano-db-sync-compare

Check whether **two [cardano-db-sync](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync)
databases hold the same blockchain data** — fast enough to use as a release gate
on mainnet-sized (500 GB+) databases.

cardano-db-sync follows the Cardano chain and writes it into PostgreSQL so normal
SQL tools can read it. When a new db-sync version is released, you want proof that
it produced **the same data** as the previous version over the same chain — no
dropped rows, no corrupted values. This tool gives you that proof, per table, and
points at *where* in the chain any difference is.

It deliberately does **not** compare the two databases byte-for-byte (that would
be wrong — see [why](#why-its-built-this-way)). It compares them by *meaning*:
it fingerprints the actual blockchain content of every table, on the database
server, and reports which tables match and which differ.

## Quick start

```bash
# install (uv recommended)
make install                      # creates .venv, installs deps + the command
# …or with plain pip:
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .

# see exactly what it WILL do, without touching any data:
db-sync-compare \
  --db1 "dbname=mainnet_v1 host=/var/run/postgresql" \
  --db2 "dbname=mainnet_v2 host=/var/run/postgresql" \
  --plan

# a fast spot-check over a small window of the chain:
db-sync-compare --db1 ... --db2 ... --block-range 8000000:8010000

# the full pre-release comparison (writes a JSON report):
db-sync-compare --db1 ... --db2 ... --json report.json
```

Exit code is `0` if the databases are content-equivalent over the compared range,
`1` if discrepancies are found, `2` on an operational error — so it drops
straight into CI. Full option reference: [docs/05-running-it.md](docs/05-running-it.md).

## Getting started from scratch (step by step)

A complete walkthrough, assuming nothing.

### 0. What you need first

- **Python 3.10+** (`python3 --version`).
- **Two cardano-db-sync PostgreSQL databases to compare** — this tool does **not**
  create or sync them; it reads two databases that **already exist** (e.g. one per
  db-sync version). You need an account that can **read** both (read-only is
  enough — the tool never writes to them).
- That's it. No Cardano node, no superuser. Optionally [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
  for the fast install path below.

### 1. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArturWieczorek/cardano-db-sync-compare.git
cd cardano-db-sync-compare
```

### 2. Install (pick one path)

```bash
# Path A — pip (works everywhere)
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .            # installs psycopg + the `db-sync-compare` command

# Path B — uv (faster; `make install` uses it). Install uv once, then:
make install                # creates .venv, installs everything, opens a shell
```

Either way you now have a `db-sync-compare` command (equivalently
`python -m db_sync_comparator`). Check it:

```bash
db-sync-compare --version
```

### 3. Point it at your two databases

Each DB is a libpq **connection string** (`conninfo`). The common shapes:

```bash
# local PostgreSQL over the Unix socket (peer auth — no password):
"dbname=mydb_v1 host=/var/run/postgresql"

# remote / TCP with a user + password:
"host=10.0.0.5 port=5432 dbname=mydb_v1 user=cexplorer password=secret"
```

If you'd rather not put the password in the command, put it in a
[pgpass file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html) and pass
`--pgpass /path/to/pgpass`. **Sanity-check connectivity first** with `psql`:

```bash
psql "dbname=mydb_v1 host=/var/run/postgresql" -c "select max(block_no) from block;"
```

If that prints a block number for **both** databases, you're ready.

### 4. Dry run — see the plan, touch no data

Always start here. It prints, per table, exactly what SQL it will run and how
it's bounded — and proves it understands your schema:

```bash
db-sync-compare \
  --db1 "dbname=mydb_v1 host=/var/run/postgresql" \
  --db2 "dbname=mydb_v2 host=/var/run/postgresql" \
  --plan
```

Confirm there are **`0` UNMAPPED columns** in the output (the tool knows every
foreign key). If you see `UNMAPPED`, your db-sync schema is newer than the
tool's registry — see [docs/09](docs/09-extending-and-limitations.md).

### 5. Fast spot-check on a small slice

Validates end-to-end quickly before a long run (compares one block window):

```bash
db-sync-compare --db1 "..." --db2 "..." --block-range 8000000:8010000
```

### 6. The real comparison

```bash
db-sync-compare --db1 "..." --db2 "..." --json report.json --verify-accumulators
```

This compares everything up to the **common tip** and writes a machine-readable
`report.json`. On **mainnet-sized** (500 GB+) databases this runs for hours and
should be launched **detached** — see
[Running on mainnet](#running-on-mainnet-operational-guide) below for the exact
`nohup` invocation, what files to watch, and hardware/disk needs.

### 7. Read the result

The summary line and per-table lines tell you everything; exit code for CI:

| exit | meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | content-equivalent over the compared range |
| `1` | a real discrepancy (or per-table error) was found |
| `2` | couldn't run (e.g. connection failure) |

`MATCH` = identical; `HASH_DIFF`/`COUNT_DIFF`/`VALUE_DIFF` = a real difference
(the tool prints *where* in the chain); an **accumulator** `COUNT_DIFF` or a
`0 vs N` count is usually expected (tip gap / a feature disabled in config) — the
output says so. Full interpretation guide: [docs/05](docs/05-running-it.md#reading-the-output).

### 8. Learn more

New to the concepts (indexing, hashing, why row ids differ between DBs)? The
[docs](docs/00-start-here.md) teach everything from zero with analogies.

---

## Why it's built this way

Two db-sync databases built from the same chain are **not** stored identically,
and a naive "read every row and compare" gets all of the following wrong. The
design is a direct response to three problems (the full story, from first
principles and with analogies, is in [docs/](docs/00-start-here.md)):

1. **Different tips.** One database is usually synced further than the other.
   → The tool compares only up to a **common chain boundary**, applied per table
   through an **indexed id-range window** (no whole-table scans).

2. **Surrogate id drift.** Every row gets an auto-numbered `id` from a sequence;
   rollbacks burn id numbers, so two syncs of the same chain end up with
   **different** `id`s for the same row — and every foreign key inherits the
   drift. (Measured on real mainnet DBs: 13.6.0.5 had 16,899 id-gaps in `block`,
   13.7.1.0 had 10.) → The tool **drops the `id`** and **translates every foreign
   key to the natural key** (block hash, tx hash, …) of the row it points at, so
   it compares meaning, not bookkeeping.

3. **Scale.** `ma_tx_out` has ~1.1 **billion** rows. → All hashing happens
   **inside PostgreSQL** as an order-independent, duplicate-safe **set hash**
   (sum of per-row MD5s); only a count and two numbers cross the wire. The few
   giant tables get **tiered** cheaper checks by default. On a mismatch, a
   **binary search** over chain ranges localizes it to a narrow block window.

These ideas are the same family used by battle-tested tools like Percona's
`pt-table-checksum` and Datafold's `data-diff`; the bespoke parts — natural-key
translation, a hand-built logical-FK map (db-sync declares no FK constraints),
and schema-drift tolerance — are what those generic tools can't do here. The
trade-offs behind each choice are written up in
[docs/04-what-i-used-and-why.md](docs/04-what-i-used-and-why.md).

Dependencies point inward toward `model`/`registries`; importing the top-level
package pulls in **no** database driver, so the pure-logic modules unit-test
without psycopg installed.

### Source of truth for the schema

`db_sync_comparator/registries.py` encodes db-sync schema knowledge (natural
keys, logical foreign keys, anchors) by hand — it **mirrors** db-sync but isn't
authoritative. When the schema changes, cross-check upstream, **at the git tag
matching the db-sync version you're comparing** (`master` runs ahead of releases):
the [schema reference](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/schema.md),
the [schema source](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/tree/master/cardano-db/src/Cardano/Db/Schema)
(the authoritative Haskell definitions), and the
[migrations / on-the-wire DDL](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/tree/master/cardano-db/test/schema).
See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [docs/09](docs/09-extending-and-limitations.md).

## Status

Validated against two real **mainnet** databases:

| | cardano-db-sync 13.6.0.5 | cardano-db-sync 13.7.1.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Size | 496 GB | 503 GB |
| Tip | block 13,313,031 / epoch 626 | block 13,488,662 / epoch 634 |
| Rollback id-gaps in `block` | 16,899 | 10 |

Every comparable table matched across the full shared history **except one** —
and that one was a real bug:

> **db-sync 13.7.1.0 stores stake-pool relay ports above 32767 as negative
> numbers** (a signed-16-bit overflow: `52636` is stored as `-12900`). 13.6.0.5
> stores them correctly; ~1,100+ mainnet relays are affected. The tool found and
> pinpointed it automatically — see the
> [case study](docs/08-case-study-pool-relay-port.md).

A full mainnet comparison surfaced **four** real data differences and the tool
explained every one: three known/fixed db-sync issues it independently
re-detected — pointer-address encoding (#2053, `tx_out`), `epoch.out_sum`/`fees`
corruption (#2118, repaired by migration 0048), and the zero-amount `epoch_stake`
cleanup (migration 0047) — plus the previously-unreported `pool_relay.port`
regression above. The rest were expected config/tip differences. Full root-cause
writeup: [benchmarks/INVESTIGATION-13.6.0.5-vs-13.7.1.0.md](benchmarks/INVESTIGATION-13.6.0.5-vs-13.7.1.0.md).

**Measured full run:** the complete comparison (tiered, `--workers 6`) took
**9h 42m** — dominated by the billion-row giants: `ma_tx_out` 2h17m (1.12B rows),
`tx_in` 1h48m, `tx_out` 1h29m (+ its Phase-2 localization), `collateral_tx_in`
1h04m, `reward` 51m. The raw report and per-table timings are committed under
[`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/) (`mainnet-full-2026-06-05.{json,log,SUMMARY.md}`).

## Running on mainnet (operational guide)

A full mainnet comparison runs for **hours** and leans on the database server
hard. Lessons from a real 500 GB run:

**Run it independently of your shell and of any agent/automation.** It's a
long-lived batch job — don't tie its lifetime to an interactive session.

```bash
# detached, survives logout/disconnect; unbuffered so the log streams live
nohup python -u -m db_sync_comparator \
  --db1 "dbname=mainnet_v1 host=/var/run/postgresql" \
  --db2 "dbname=mainnet_v2 host=/var/run/postgresql" \
  --workers 6 --json report.json > run.log 2>&1 &

tail -f run.log          # watch per-table OK/!! lines + seconds (compute ETA)
```

**Exactly one process needs `nohup`: the comparison command above**
(`python -u -m db_sync_comparator …`, equivalently `db-sync-compare …`).
Everything else is optional. It produces two files you will use:

| File | When written | What to check it for |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| `run.log` (stdout, `-u`) | live, line by line | **progress** — one `OK`/`!!` line + seconds per table; the final **`SUMMARY:`** line (counts of match / discrepancies / accumulator deltas / errors); the **`DISCREPANCIES:`** and **`ERRORS:`** blocks; and the wrapper's **`FINISHED rc=… WALL_SECONDS=…`** line (exit code + total wall-clock) |
| `report.json` (`--json`) | once, at the very end | the **machine-readable result** — per-table `status`, row counts, the two set-hashes, `seconds`, `localized` windows, `skipped_cols`. This is what you archive, diff between runs, or feed to CI |

When it finishes, triage in three commands:

```bash
grep -E '^SUMMARY|^FINISHED' run.log          # verdict + total wall-clock
grep -E '^  !! |DISCREPANC|ERROR' run.log      # everything that did NOT match
# exit code: 0 = content-equivalent, 1 = discrepancy/error found, 2 = couldn't run
```

Other lessons:

- **Don't set a short `--statement-timeout`** (default `0` = none). Individual
  giant-table scans can take **30–60+ min**; a timeout would abort them and fail
  the run for no good reason.
- **A notifier must be detached too.** The comparison is the only thing that
  *must* be `nohup`'d; but if you also want a "tell me when it's done" watcher, it
  has to be detached as well (`nohup`/`tmux`/`systemd-run`) and communicate via
  files — a process tied to your shell dies on logout. Pattern: the runner writes
  `run.log`/`report.json`; a second detached one-liner waits
  (`until grep -q '^FINISHED' run.log; do sleep 60; done`) and then copies the
  results somewhere stable.
- **It does not modify the databases** — every query is read-only, so a crash or
  a kill can't corrupt or shrink either DB. Safe to stop and re-run.
- Re-run from a clean checkout with `--plan` first to confirm **0 unmapped FKs**
  against the current schema (see [Source of truth](#source-of-truth-for-the-schema)).

## Hardware & resource requirements

Read-only on the *data*, but **not** free on resources. The one that surprises
people (and makes free disk space visibly fluctuate during the run):

- **Disk — large *temporary* files (the important one).** Translating foreign
  keys to natural keys hash-joins the giant tables (`ma_tx_out`, `tx_out`,
  `tx_in`, …) against `tx`/`datum`/`stake_address`. When a join's hash table
  exceeds `work_mem` it **spills to PostgreSQL temp files** (`base/pgsql_tmp`).
  On the validation run this produced **hundreds of GB of temp I/O cumulatively**
  (~478 GB on one DB, ~255 GB on the other) with **tens of GB live at peak** — so
  **free disk space rises and falls** as each big query spills and then releases.
  It's transient (nothing is written to the databases themselves), but you need
  **ample free disk headroom**: budget tens of GB free, more with more `--workers`
  or with `--full`. You can hard-cap it with PostgreSQL's `temp_file_limit`, or
  move it off the data disk with a dedicated `temp_tablespaces`.
- **RAM.** The client (this tool) is tiny — ~10–40 MB; *all* the heavy work runs
  inside PostgreSQL. The real RAM cost is server-side and roughly
  `workers × (concurrent hash/sort operations) × work_mem`, plus `shared_buffers`,
  plus OS page cache used while scanning ~500 GB. At `--workers 6 --work-mem 256MB`
  that's a few GB of `work_mem` at peak. Raising `--work-mem` trades RAM for less
  temp-disk spill.
- **Swap — not the lever here, just a safety net.** PostgreSQL does **not** page
  `work_mem` out to OS swap: when a hash/sort exceeds `work_mem` it spills to
  **temp files on disk** (the point above), not to swap. So adding swap won't make
  the run faster or absorb that temp pressure — the real levers are `--work-mem`,
  `--workers`, and free **temp disk**. Keep only a **small** swap (≈2–8 GB, or up
  to ~1× RAM capped around 8–16 GB) purely as an OOM cushion in case you over-size
  `--work-mem × --workers`, and set `vm.swappiness` **low** (1–10) so the kernel
  doesn't evict the page cache / PostgreSQL into swap and thrash the scans. If you
  find the box actually swapping during a run, that's a signal to *lower*
  `--work-mem`/`--workers`, not to add more swap.
- **CPU / disk IO.** Sustained sequential reads of the whole ~500 GB plus `md5`
  hashing across cores; expect it to saturate disk read bandwidth. Run it when the
  box can spare the IO.

**Tuning the disk ↔ RAM tradeoff:**

| You have… | Do this | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| tight disk | raise `--work-mem` (e.g. `1GB`) and/or lower `--workers` | less temp spill, more RAM, maybe slower |
| tight RAM | keep `--work-mem` modest, lower `--workers` | more temp spill (need disk), gentler on RAM |
| plenty of both | more `--workers` | faster wall-clock, more concurrent temp + RAM |

Avoid `--full` on mainnet unless you have the disk and time — it deep-joins the
1.1B-row `ma_tx_out` and multiplies temp usage. More detail and measured numbers
are in [docs/07-performance-and-scaling.md](docs/07-performance-and-scaling.md).

## Development

```bash
make check     # what CI runs: ruff check + ruff format --check + mypy + pytest
make test      # pytest only
make lint      # ruff check
make format    # ruff format (apply)
make typecheck # mypy
```

Install the git hooks so the same checks run before every commit (CI runs them
too, so passing locally is the cheapest way to keep CI green):

```bash
pre-commit install
```

`make test` runs the **DB-free** suite (pure-logic unit tests). There are also
two database-backed suites, both excluded from the default run:

```bash
# End-to-end tests on tiny SYNTHETIC fixtures against a real PostgreSQL.
# Spins a throwaway cluster via pytest-postgresql (or set
# DBSYNC_COMPARE_PG_EXTERNAL=1 + PG* to use an existing server / CI service).
# They seed two miniature db-sync-shaped DBs with deliberate id drift, a tip
# gap, and faults (corrupted value, dropped row, the pool_relay port overflow)
# and assert the tool classifies each correctly.
make test-db                       # = pytest -m fixture

# Integration tests against your OWN two db-sync databases (opt-in):
export DBSYNC_COMPARE_TEST_DSN1="dbname=v1 host=/var/run/postgresql"
export DBSYNC_COMPARE_TEST_DSN2="dbname=v2 host=/var/run/postgresql"
pytest -m integration
```

CI runs the DB-free suite on Python 3.10–3.12 and the `fixture` suite against a
PostgreSQL service container. The full testing strategy — what each tier is for,
why PostgreSQL and not SQLite, and how the synthetic fixtures work — is in
[docs/10-testing.md](docs/10-testing.md).

Start at **[docs/00-start-here.md](docs/00-start-here.md)**. The docs assume only
basic database words (table, row, primary/foreign key) and teach everything else
— indexing, hashing, Cardano, db-sync, id drift — from zero, with analogies.
